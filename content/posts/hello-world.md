As they say, "Hello, World!" and welcome to my blog on [enbnt.dev](/).

My name is Ian Bennett and I have been a professional in the software industry for 15+ 
years. I have worked on notable projects, such as Twitter's GraphQL Home Timeline 
migration, Finagle & Finatra OSS projects, Twitter's world-scale Observability platform, along
with the productization (and miniaturization) of the IBM Watson AI from what was seen on
the "Jeopardy!" television show. If you are looking for more info on these projects, 
see my [About](/about) page!

I am now a free agent after 6.5 years with Twitter and I'm looking forward to the next phase of my career.

I'm still figuring out how I will use this site and blog, but I know that
I have a lot of experience and learnings to share. I think I'm going to keep this space more dedicated
to the technical and software side of things, but I may sprinkle in some of the other
things that bring me joy from time to time. Thanks for stopping by and I hope to see you
here for the next post!
